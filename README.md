Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  This project started with GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py completed. This set parameters for the maze and how the AI would interact with the environment of the game. 
the qtrain method in the ipynb file was started but needed code to allow the AI to take actions and teach itself to be more efficient with it's decision making. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  Computer scientists play a role in many areas of our society. From the development of cutting-edge technologies, to development of software and hardware for smartphones, Computer scientists work in areas such as scientific research, Data analytics, the space industry and many more. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  My first step is to "stand on the shoulder of giants." There is no reason to re-invent the wheel for every new challenge experienced. If i can imagine it, come across it, think it up or are asked to solve something, chances are someone else has also and even if someone elses solution wouldn't be a perfect match, building on others learning experiences can only serve to improve my own. "A smart man learns from his mistakes, a wise man learns from others mistakes." (unkknown).
  
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  Ethical considerations for new and growing technologies can be a tricky problem set. The primary drivers and inventors of technology are not normally dedicated to philosophy and ethics. Pushing technologies and considering the ethics as an afterthought can have serious reprocutions. It is our job as a society to maintain the "social contract" and hold eachother to whatâ€™s right legally and socially.
